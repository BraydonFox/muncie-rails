# The Muncie Rails Project
Muncie Rails is designed to be both an interactive guidebook for the Muncie railfan, as well as an immersive guide to Muncie's rich railroading history.

The entire site features a responsive and lightweight design, allowing for use on a wider variety of devices.

Utilizing the Google Maps Javascript API, historically significant landmarks and train watching locations are loaded in via a static JSON file and added to the map.
Selecting a location brings up a formatted Google Maps info window, containing a short description of the site.

This project is currently live in a prototype state. Visit it <a href="https://muncierails.com">here</a>.
