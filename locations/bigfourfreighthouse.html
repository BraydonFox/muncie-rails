    <h1>The "Big Four" Freight House</h1>
    <p>
        In 1920, the Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago, and St. Louis Railway (more commonly known as the Big Four Railroad)
        built a brick two-story freight agency office with an attached one-story freight building at this location.
    </p>
    <p>
        This freight house was a building designed to transfer small "less-than-carload" shipments that could not fill a single freight car.
        Local horse-and-wagon teams (and later trucks) provided local pickup and delivery of the small shipments between the railroads and their customers.
        Boxcars would be loaded on the north side facing the tracks, and trucks would be loaded on the south side.
    </p>
    <p>
        The development of truck transportation in the mid-1900s dramatically altered the freight business of railroads and eliminated the less-than-carload shipment business.
        Trucking companies do not bear the full taxation or cost of ownership, construction and maintenance of roads or the traffic control systems.
        In contrast, railroads bear the full cost of construction, maintenance and taxation of their individual track rights-of-way, signal control systems and facilities.
        As a result, industries stopped building adjacent to rail lines, and the local freight business began to decline for the railroad industry.
    </p>
    <p>
        After Big Four's successor, The New York Central, stopped handling their own small shipments, freight forwarding companies operated out of this freight house.
        The building is still standing and appears vacant, but has been leased by various businesses over the years.
