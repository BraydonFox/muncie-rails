            The depot was built in 1901 by the Cincinnati, Richmond, and Muncie Railroad. The CR&M would later be acquired
            by the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway in 1910. The C&O ended passenger service to Muncie in 1949, and the depot was
            then used for freight services until the Muncie Gear Works began leasing the building.

            1973 saw the incorporation of the "Chessie System", a holding company composed of the Chesapeake
            and Ohio and other railroad companies. The Chessie System restored the depot to service passengers on
            Amtrak's <em>"Cardinal"</em>. The depot itself was not open to passengers, and only the outisde platform
            was used.

            In 1985, Amtrak re-routed <em>The Cardinal</em>, and Muncie lost its last passenger train.
            With no passengers to serve, the depot was left abandonded by Chessie Systems successor, CSX Transportation.

            In 1993, Cardinal Greenways, Inc. purchased the Wysor Street Depot, along with 60 miles of former railroad
            right-of-way.

            Today, the station is beautifully restored to its former glory and serves as a visitor's center and trailhead
            for the Cardinal Greenway. The Cardinal Greenway uses the roadbed that used to support the tracks of the C&O railroad.

            Although the C&O tracks are long gone, another parallel rail line (part of Norfolk Southern's New Castle District)
            is still in operation, separated from the trail by a safety fence.
